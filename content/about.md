  I'm Saptarshi, a Ph.D. candidate in [Statistics at UC Berkeley](https://statistics.berkeley.edu/), advised by [Prof. Peter Bartlett](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~bartlett/). Before joining here, I completed both my Bachelor of Statistics and Master of Statistics at the [Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata](https://www.isical.ac.in/).
  
 Equipped with a strong mathematical foundation I'm interested to explore the depths of statistical statistical learning, especially deep learning and its real-world applications. My current research is primarily focused on exploring and understanding why deep learners work from a statistical viewpoint. 
 
In my free time I enjoy hiking, reading novels and cooking exotic dishes. 

I warmly welcome the opportunity to connect with like-minded professionals, researchers, and mentors. Please feel free to reach out through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anirban-chatterjee-99742611b/) or via email at <span style="color: navy;">anirbanc@wharton.upenn.edu</span>.
