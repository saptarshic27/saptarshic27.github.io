  I'm Saptarshi, a Ph.D. candidate in [Statistics at UC Berkeley](https://statistics.berkeley.edu/), advised by [Prof. Peter Bartlett](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~bartlett/). Before joining here, I completed both my Bachelor of Statistics and Master of Statistics at the [Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata](https://www.isical.ac.in/).
  
 Equipped with a strong mathematical foundation I'm interested to explore the depths of statistical learning, especially deep learning and its real-world applications. My current research is primarily focused on exploring and understanding why deep learners work from a statistical viewpoint. My doctoral research explores the behavior of different deep learners, especially, generative models under the so-called "manifold hypothesis". More details about my current works can be found [here](https://saptarshic27.github.io/research/).
 
In my free time I enjoy hiking, reading novels and cooking exotic dishes.
