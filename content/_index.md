I'm Saptarshi Chakraborty (সপ্তর্ষি চক্রবর্তী), a fifth-year Ph.D. student in Statistics at the Department of Statistics, University of California, Berkeley, advised by [Prof. Peter Bartlett](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~bartlett/). Prior to joining Berkeley, I completed M.Stat and B. Stat (Hons.) degrees in Statistics from Indian Statistical Institute (ISI), Kolkata, India. I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Swagatm Das](https://www.isical.ac.in/~swagatam.das/). Prior to that, I spent eleven enriching years of my childhood studying at Hindu School, Kolkata.
