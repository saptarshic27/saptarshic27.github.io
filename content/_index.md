I am Saptarshi Chakraborty (সপ্তর্ষি চক্রবর্তী), an incoming Assistant Professor of Statistics at the University of Michigan. I recently completed my Ph.D. in Statistics at [UC Berkeley](https://statistics.berkeley.edu/), where I had the privilege of being advised by [Prof. Peter Bartlett](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~bartlett/). Before that, I earned my M.Stat and B.Stat (Hons.) degrees in Statistics from the [Indian Statistical Institute (ISI), Kolkata](https://www.isical.ac.in/), under the mentorship of [Prof. Swagatam Das](https://www.isical.ac.in/~swagatam.das/). My academic journey began at [Hindu School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_School,_Kolkata), Kolkata, where I spent eleven formative years of my early education.
