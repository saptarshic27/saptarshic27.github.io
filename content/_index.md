I'm Saptarshi Chakraborty (সপ্তর্ষি চক্রবর্তী), a fifth-year Ph.D. student in Statistics at [the Department of Statistics, University of California, Berkeley](https://statistics.berkeley.edu/), where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Peter Bartlett](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~bartlett/). Prior to joining Berkeley, I earned both my M.Stat and B. Stat (Hons.) degrees in Statistics from [Indian Statistical Institute (ISI), Kolkata](https://www.isical.ac.in/), India, under the guidance of [Prof. Swagatm Das](https://www.isical.ac.in/~swagatam.das/). Prior to that, I spent eleven enriching years of my childhood studying at [Hindu School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_School,_Kolkata), Kolkata.
